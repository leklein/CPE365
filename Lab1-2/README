CPE 365 - Spring 2017
Lauren Klein, Andrew Gough

The command to compile the code is:

javac schoolsearch.java Student.java

The command to run the program is:

java schoolsearch

Our new commands for NR1-NR5 are as follows:

NR1 - C[lassroom]: <number>
NR2 - C[lassroom]: <number> [T[eacher]]
NR3 - G[rade]: <number> [T[eacher]
NR4 - E[nrollment]
NR5 - D[ata] [[G]rade] [T[eacher]] [B[us]]

We chose to not include the students' names in NR5 because they would/should not play a part
in any general trends.  Essentially, they would just need the Y variable and the X variables.

Instead, every student's GPA would be printed, followed by optionally the grade level, teacher,
and bus route, depending on which flags the user included (in that order).
